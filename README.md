# Basic Library

### Aims

- create a basic library app using Vanilla JavaScript
- allow the user to add and delete books, as well as toggle if books are read or not
- use CSS to style the webpage (and try combining grid and flex)

### Future steps

Should I want to take this project further I would:

- add a backend to enable you to save your books when the page reloads
- make the design responsive for mobiles
- create a login system so multiple users could have libraries saved
- add additional features such as 'to read' and 'favourites'
